# SASS

### Sass(Syntactically awesome stylesheets)
- CSS Processor/extension
- We can create variables with prefix '$' in scss files.
- It is easy to read and write that other custom css properties.
- We can able to write styles with nesting.
- we can break our css into separate file and we can use them into a main.scss file.
- when we are starting with '_'a scss file name. that is not going to compile.
In Sass we have functions and mixins . which allow us to create blocks of css that we can run wherever we want.
