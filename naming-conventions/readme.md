## Bad Naming patterns
- Using single word for naming variables.
- Never using abbreviations(abbreviations helps to saved typing time, line-length inside window.)

- Avoid using units in variable names
  - eg: `void execute(int delay)` ==> `void execute(int delaySeconds)`
- Adding types to your types
