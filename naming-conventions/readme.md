# Javascript naming

## Bad Naming patterns
- Using single word for naming variables.
- Never using abbreviations(abbreviations helps to saved typing time, line-length inside window.)
- Using types in you variable names
- Avoid using units in variable names
  - eg: `void execute(int delay)` ==> `void execute(int delaySeconds)`
- Adding types to your types
- Naming code utils.


## Some best naming patterns
- It is better to use `camelCase` for naming variables and functions.
- Short and meaningful.
- The names of the variables are `self-explanatory and describe` the stored value.
- In boolean variable naming it is better to use `is` or `has` as prefixes. and also `are`.
- When naming a function you can use `descriptive nouns and verbs` as prefixes.
- In the case of constants we can use `uppercase` for naming, because they are non-changing variables.
- when naming a constant variable and the name contain more than one word, you should use `snake uppercase`.
- You can user `pascal-case`  for naming a class and components in javascript.
- We must use `camel case` for naming a method in javascript and use verbs as prefixes to make names more meaningful.
- In javascript an underscore is used to denote private variables or functions.
- For global javascript variables , there are no specific naming standards.
- It is best to use `camel-case` for `mutable` global variables and `uppercase` for `immutable` global variables.
