- The @property css at-rule is part of the css houdini umbrella of APIs, it allows developers to explicitly define their css custom properties, allowing for property type checking, setting default values, and define whether a property can inherit values or not.


## At-rule
- At-rule are css statements that instruct css how to behave. they begin with an at sign, '@' (u+0040 COMMERCIAL AT), followed by an identifier and includes everything up to the next semicolon, ';' (U+003B SEMICOLON), or the next css block, whichever comes first.

#### syntax 
- ```
    general structure
    @identifier (RULE);

    Example: tells browser to use UTF-8 character set

    @charset "utf-8";

```
